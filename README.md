# Elephant-Classification-CNN
Binary image classification using transfer learning to distinguish Asian and African elephants.
Built a binary image classification CNN utilizing transfer learning to differentiate Asian and African elephants using tensorflow and techniques such as data augmentation, validation splitting, test evaluation, and training a custom classifier head to achieve a ~92% accuracy on the test data. Also visualized the learning curve using graphs. Dataset -> [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivmankar/asian-vs-african-elephant-image-classification)
